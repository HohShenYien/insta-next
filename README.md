## üëì Preview

You can find a live version of the project running on Vercel and Render below

**Vercel**: https://insta-next-alpha.vercel.app

**Render**: https://insta-next.onrender.com/

Here's the credentials of a random user if you wish to try it out (All users' passwords are secret)

```
email: Rod.Raynor20@hotmail.com
password: secret
```

Note: I've used a free version of the web & database server. You can expect them to run slow or even break due to that reason. (Mainly due to the limit of 5 concurrent sessions of the database)

## üõ† Installation & Set Up

Please refer to the blogs for the full installation process with explanation, but here's the full installation for the final codes

1. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. Copy `.env.example` into a new `.env` file, and add an environment variable, `DATABASE_URL` which links to a PostgreSQL database

3. Initialize your database

   ```bash
   yarn migrate
   yarn seed # depends if you wish to prefill the database with values or not
   ```

4. Run the development server

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## ‚ùì Why is Feature X missing?

I built this project solely for my [blog series](https://blogs.shenyien.cyou/series/insta-next), so this project isn't meant to be a full clone.
