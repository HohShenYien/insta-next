## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up
Please refer to Part 1 & Part 2 for the full installation process with explanation, but if you're at later series, here's how you can do it

1. Install the dependencies
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. Create an empty `.env` file, and add an environment variable, `DATABASE_URL` which links to a PostgreSQL database
3. Initialize your database

   ```bash
   yarn migrate
   yarn seed # depends if you wish to prefill the database with values or not
   ```
   
4. Run the development server

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
